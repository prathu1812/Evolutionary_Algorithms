# Evolutionary Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) repository! This is a comprehensive collection of implementations for some of the most popular EAs. Both Python and MATLAB codes are provided to cater to a wide audience.

## Algorithms Included:
- **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)**
- **Differential Evolution (DE)**
- **Firefly Algorithm**
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**

Each algorithm is meticulously coded to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or just someone curious about EAs, this repository is your one-stop solution to dive deep into the world of evolutionary computation.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired algorithm's folder.
3. Choose between Python and MATLAB implementations.
4. Run the code in the respective environment.
